Q4. List all active processes and save only those containing the word java into a file.

**ps aux | grep [j]ava > processes.txt**


//COMMANDS TO NOTE
**ps aux** => to list all currently running processes

**grep [j]ava** => to show processes containing the word "java"

**grep [j]ava > processes.txt** => to store the processes containing the word "java", in a file
==> grep [j]ava is a regex technique which we need to use here since we are listing all current processes using pipe ==> if we do not use [j]ava then the grep process itself will also be shown in the results since it contains "java".
