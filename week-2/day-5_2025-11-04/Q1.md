Q1. Find and terminate the top memory-consuming process on your system.

shreya-mathur@TTNPL-10419:~$ **top**
PID   USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES     SHR S     %CPU   %MEM  TIME+    COMMAND             
49402 shreya-+  20   0    12.0g   757432  258052 S  14.0   4.7  11:23.58  firefox             

shreya-mathur@TTNPL-10419:~$ **sudo kill 49402**
[sudo] password for shreya-mathur: 


//COMMANDS TO NOTE
**top** => is a real-time system monitoring tool. 
==> It provides a dynamic, continuously updating view of processes and system resource usage.
==> The process using the most CPU appears at the top.
**kill 49402** => uses the -15(SIGTERM) signal by default which terminates the process gracefully

Note -
    User can kill a processs they started
    If a user wants to kill a process started by another user, they have to use **sudo kill 49402** (should have sudo privileges)

Common kill signals:
    SIGTERM (15): Always try this first for normal shutdown.
    SIGKILL (9): Use only when process is unresponsive; it cannot be handled.
    SIGHUP (1): Handy for reloading configs without stopping a service.
    SIGINT (2): What you trigger with Ctrl+C in the terminal.
